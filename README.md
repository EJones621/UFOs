## Summary
##### Drawback
One drawback from from the website are that the filters are off to the side so it's not as simple to someone new to the website. Another drawback is that the search is limited to one value per search field.

2. Updating the search functions to accept multiple values
3. Add a section for users to add their emails to receive more information on UFOs
